Using API very simple example.

Project Description: This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to generate book recommendations on the topic of coding using Node.js.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18.13.0 or compatible version)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install project dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
Usage
Run the following command to execute the script:

Copy code
node app.js
The script will use the OpenAI API to generate a list of great books to read on the topic of coding. The results will be displayed in the terminal.

Code Explanation
The app.js file contains the code to interact with the OpenAI API. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

Import necessary modules: The code imports the Configuration and OpenAIApi classes from the openai package. It also loads environment variables from the .env file using the dotenv package.

Set up OpenAI configuration: The API key from the .env file is used to set up the Configuration object, which will be used to authenticate API requests.

Define the fetchFactAnswer function: This function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate book recommendations on the topic of coding. It uses the createCompletion method with the model set to 'text-davinci-003' and the prompt set to a sample prompt asking for book recommendations. The max_tokens and stop options are used to control the response length and stop tokens.

Execute the function: The fetchFactAnswer function is called, and the book recommendations are displayed in the terminal using console.log.

Note: Make sure to replace your_openai_api_key_here in the .env file with your actual OpenAI API key.

Additional Notes
Remember not to commit the .env file to version control as it contains sensitive information.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to the project contributors or OpenAI support.
